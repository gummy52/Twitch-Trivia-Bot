This program will run trivia in the channel specified in 'login.txt'. 
Edit '#gummy52' with your channel name, such as '#myChannelName', and you're ready to go.

By default the Bot runs under the user name 'Triviabotstwitch'. 
If you want your bot to have its own name then register an account and replace 'Triviabotstwitch' with its name.

Next, while logged into that account, visit http://twitchapps.com/tmi/ to acquire the oauth token for that account.
Finally, edit the 'login.txt' accordingly with that oauth.
